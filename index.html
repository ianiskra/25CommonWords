        A PROGRAMMing language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of
        output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

        Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set
        of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention of the
        digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the
        brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.[1] Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to
        direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.[2] The programs for these
        machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs
        or conditions.

        Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many
        programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while
        other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).

        The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and
        semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming
        language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation
        that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and
        extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

        A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or
        algorithm.[3] Some authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express all
        possible algorithms.[3][4] Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language
        include:

        Function and target
        A computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a computer
        performing some kind of computation[5] or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers, disk
        drives, robots,[6] and so on. For example, PostScript programs are frequently created by another program to
        control a computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some,
        possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language
        includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language.[7] In most practical
        contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined
        and studied this way.[8] Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only
        used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions
        to machines.
        Abstractions
        Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling
        the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is
        expressed by the abstraction principle.[9] This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the
        programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.[10]
        Expressive power
        The theory of computation classifies languages by the computations they are capable of expressing. All Turing
        complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples of
        languages that are not Turing complete, yet often called programming languages.[11][12]

        Markup languages like XML, HTML, or troff, which define structured data, are not usually considered programming
        languages.[13][14][15] Programming languages may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if a
        computational semantics is defined. XSLT, for example, is a Turing complete language entirely using XML
        syntax.[16][17][18] Moreover, LaTeX, which is mostly used for structuring documents, also contains a Turing
        complete subset.[19][20]

        The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.[21] However, the usage
        of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages
        as a subset of computer languages.[22] Similarly, languages used in computing that have a different goal than
        expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are
        sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming.[23]

        Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines, and
        computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware
        resources.[24] John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming
        languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input
        formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not
        Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in
        input formats.
